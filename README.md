# testingDuckDuckGo (based on [tau-intro-selenium-py](https://github.com/AutomationPanda/tau-intro-selenium-py))
This repository contains the files generated while following the *Introduction to Selenium WebDriver with Python* course
taught by [Andrew "Pandy" Knight](https://twitter.com/AutomationPanda)
on [Test Automation University](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/).
On top of those files, several other page objects and tests were added with the intention to practice the concepts learned.

For Setup instructions, please go to [tau-intro-selenium-py](https://github.com/AutomationPanda/tau-intro-selenium-py) and follows the readme file.
